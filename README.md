# Photontorch

Photonic simulation tools for highly parallel simulation and optimization of photonic circuits in time and frequency domain.

## Introduction
Photontorch features CUDA enabled simulation and optimization of photonic circuits. It leverages the
deep learning framework PyTorch to view the photonic circuit as essentially a recurrent
neural network. This enables the use of native PyTorch optimizers to optimize the
(physical) parameters of your circuit.


## Installation
Clone the photontorch repository:
```
git clone http://github.ugent.be/fplaport/photontorch
```
and link it with `pip`:
```
pip install -e photontorch
```


## Where to start
If you don't know where to start, start going through the notebooks in the examples folder.


## Documentation
A basic documentation (based on docstrings) can be viewed and generated by typing [only with python 3]
```
python -m photontorch.documentation
```
in the folder that contains photontorch.


## Tests
Tests can be performed by using pytest:
```
pytest tests
```

To generate a test coverage report, run
```
pytest tests --cov-report html --cov photontorch
```

## Dependencies
