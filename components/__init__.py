# Components

All the photonic Components defined in PhotonTorch

Each [Component](component.Component) is generally defined by several key properties:

  * num_ports: The number of ports of the components.
  * C: The connection matrix for the component (usually all zero for base components)
  * rS: The real part of the Scattering matrix
  * iS: The imaginary part of the Scattering matrix
  * sources_at: Where there are sources in the component (usually all zero for base components)
  * detectors_at: Where there are detectors in the component (usually all zero for base components)
  * delays: delays introduced by the nodes of the component.
