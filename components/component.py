'''
# Base Component Submodule

The base component is a parent class meant for subclassing. It should not be used directly.

Each Component is generally defined by several key properties:

  * num_ports: The number of ports of the components.
  * C: The connection matrix for the component (usually all zero for base components)
  * rS: The real part of the Scattering matrix
  * iS: The imaginary part of the Scattering matrix
  * sources_at: Where there are sources in the component (usually all zero for base components)
  * detectors_at: Where there are detectors in the component (usually all zero for base components)
  * delays: delays introduced by the nodes of the component.

        Note:
            Just initializing the component with a simulation environment is not enough
            to be able to start a simulation. A connection matrix for which
            C.sum(0) == C.sum(1) == all ones is required.
            You can achieve this by connecting the component into a network with some Terms.
