together into a Network.

class Connector(object):
    '''
    The connector object is an abstract object that is invoked
    while connecting components into a network.

    It is merely there as an aid for connecting components together
    in a simplified fashion.

    Example:
        ring = wg['ij'] * wg['jk'] * wg['ki']

        during the creating of the ring, three connector components are created:
        wg['ij'] = Conn('ij', wg)
        wg['jk'] = Conn('jk', wg)
        wg['ki'] = Conn('ki', wg)

        When connectors are multiplied together, intermediate connectors are created:
        wg['ij']*wg['jk'] = Conn('ij,jk', [wg, wg])

        When all indexes are connected (there are exactly two occurences for each index), such as
        ring = wg['ij'] * wg['jk'] * wg['ki'] = Conn('ij,jk,ki',[wg,wg,wg])
        A new network object with the corresponding indices and components is automatically created.


    Useful Attribute:
        get the free indices of a connector by calling the .idxs attribute:

        In[1]:  conn.idxs
        Out[1]: 'ijkl'

    Notes:
        - Do NOT create a connector directly. In stead create a connector via the
          __getitem__ method of a component by passing a string:

          conn = comp['ijkl']

        - As an alternative to a string index, a tuple of integers can be given. These
          integers will be converted internally to a string:

          conn = comp['ijkl'] = comp[106,107,108,109]

          This can be useful for creating very large networks and when you run
          out of strings to index (Note that in python 2, the maximum integer number
          is 256, as unicode is not natively supported)

        - The connector does not check whether the number of indices given does correspond
          to the number of ports of the component.
