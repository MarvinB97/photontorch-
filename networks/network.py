# PhotonTorch Network

The Network is the core of Photontorch. This is where everything comes together.
The Network is a special kind of torch.nn.Module, where all subcomponents are
automatically initialized and connected in the right way.

## A note on the S- and C-matrix reduction performed during Network.initialize:
Each component can be described in terms of it's S matrix. For such a component,
we have that the output fields \(\bf x_{\rm out}\) are connected to the input fields
\(x_{\rm in}\) through a scattering matrix:
```math
x_{\rm out} = S \cdot x_{\rm in}
```
For a network of components, the field vectors \(x\) will just be stacked on top of each other,
and the S-matrix will just be the block-diagonal matrix of the S-matrices of the
individual components. However, to connect the output fields to each other, we need
a connection matrix, which connects the output fields of the individual components
to input fields of other components in the fields vector \(x\):
```math
x_{\rm in} = C \cdot x_{\rm out}
```
a simulation (without delays) can thus simply be described by:
```math
x(t+1) = C\cdot S\cdot x(t)
```
However, when delays come in the picture, the situation is a bit more complex. We then
split the fields vector \(x\) in a memory_containing part (mc) and a memory-less part (ml):
```math
\begin{pmatrix}x^{\rm mc} \\x^{\rm ml} \end{pmatrix}(t+1) =
\begin{pmatrix} C^{\rm mcmc} & C^{\rm mcml} \\ C^{\rm mlmc} & C^{\rm mlml} \end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix} S^{\rm mcmc} & S^{\rm mcml} \\ S^{\rm mlmc} & S^{\rm mlml} \end{pmatrix}
\cdot\begin{pmatrix}x^{\rm mc} \\x^{\rm ml} \end{pmatrix}(t)
```
Usually, we are only interested in the memory-containing nodes, as memory-less nodes
should be connected together and act all at once. After some matrix algebra we arrive at
```math
\begin{align}
x^{\rm mc}(t+1) &= \left( C^{\rm mcmc} + C^{\rm mcml}\cdot S^{\rm mlml}\cdot
\left(1-C^{\rm mlml}S^{\rm mlml}\right)^{-1} C^{\rm mlmc}\right)S^{\rm mcmc} x^{\rm mc}(t) \\
&= C^{\rm red} x^{\rm mc}(t),
\end{align}
```
Which defines the reduced connection matrix used in the simulations.

## A note on complex matrix inverse

PyTorch still does not allow complex valued Tensors. Therefore, the above equation was
completely rewritten with matrices containing the real and imaginary parts.
This would be fairly straightforward if it were not for the matrix inverse in the
reduced connection matrix:
```math
P^{-1} = \left(1-C^{\rm mlml}S^{\rm mlml}\right)^{-1}
```

unfortunately for complex matrices \(P^{-1} \neq {\rm real}(P)^{-1} + i{\rm imag}(P)^{-1}\),
the actual case is a bit more complicated.

It is however, pretty clear from the equations that the \({\rm real}(P)^{-1}\) will always
exist, and thus we can write for the real and imaginary part of \(P^{-1}\):


```math
\begin{align}
{\rm real}(P^{-1}) &= \left({\rm real}(P) + {\rm imag}(P)\cdot {\rm real}(P)^{-1} \cdot {\rm imag}(P)\right)^{-1}\\
{\rm real}(P^{-1}) &= -{\rm real}(P^{-1})\cdot {\rm imag}(P) \cdot {\rm real}(P)^{-1}
\end{align}
```
This equation is valid, even if \({\rm imag}(P)^{-1}\) does not exist.

        Initializer of the network. The initializer should be called before
        doing any simulation (forward pass through the network). It creates all the
        internal variables necessary.

        Args:
            env (Environment): Simulation environment.

        The Initializer should in principle also be called after every training Epoch to
        update the parameters of the network.

        The goal of this initialization is to split the network into memory-containing nodes
        (nodes that introduce delay, sources, detectors, ...) and memory-less nodes.
        A matrix reduction method is then applied to remove the memory-less nodes from the
        S-matrix and C-matrix. It is with these reduced matrices that the simulation will
        then be performed.

        The resulting reduced matrices will also be reordered, such that source nodes
        will be the first nodes and detector nodes will be the last nodes. This is done
        purely for ease of access afterwards.

        Note:
            during initialization, the reduced connection matrix is calculated for all
            batches and for all wavelengths. This is a quite lengthy calculation, because
            the matrices need to be (batch) multiplied in the right way. Below, you can find
            the equation for the reduced connection matrix if you get lost:
            ```math
            C^{\rm red} = \left(1-C^{\rm mlml}S^{\rm mlml}\right)^{-1} C^{\rm mlmc}
            ```

        Note:
            During initialization, it will be checked if the network is fully connected.
            If the network is not fully connected, the initialization will not be finalized.
            (and the self.initialized flag will remain False). This is to speed up
            the initialization of nested networks, where only the top level needs to be
            fully initialized.
