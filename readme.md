# Photontorch


## Introduction
Photontorch is a photonic simulation framework based on the deep learning framework PyTorch.


## Features
Photontorch features CUDA enabled optimization of photonic circuits. It leverages the
deep learning framework PyTorch to view the photonic circuit as essentially a recurrent
neural network. This enables the use of native PyTorch optimizers to optimize the
(physical) parameters of your circuit.


## Installation
First make sure all the necessary dependencies are installed. Then
clone this repository and put it in your python path.


## Where to start
If you don't know where to start, start going through the notebooks in the examples folder.


## Documentation
A basic documentation (based on docstrings) can be viewed and generated by typing [only with python 3]
```
python -m photontorch.documentation
```
in the folder that contains photontorch.


## Tests
Tests can be performed by using pytest:
```
pytest photontorch
```
in the folder that contains photontorch.

To generate a test coverage report, run
```
pytest photontorch --cov-report html --cov photontorch --verbose
```

## Dependencies
