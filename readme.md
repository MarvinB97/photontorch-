# PhotonTorch

## Introduction
PhotonTorch is a photonic simulation engine based on the deep learning framework PyTorch.

## Features
PhotonTorch features CUDA enabled optimization of photonic circuits. It leverages the
deep learning framework PyTorch to view the photonic circuit as essentially a recurrent
neural network. This enables the use of native PyTorch optimizors to optimize the
(physical) parameters of your circuit.
## Roadmap
* Ring Molecules Network
* Connection Matrix Network
* Source Functions
* Network visualizer
* Frequency domain inversion (faster frequency domain calculations)
* Additional notebook figures
* ~~Copying components~~
* ~~Possibility to ignore delays (for faster frequency domain calculations)~~
* ~~Batched Training~~
* ~~CUDA~~
* ~~Network of networks~~
