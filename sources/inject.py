# Source Injection
This module defines an injector class.
Subclassing this injector class and running self._inject_sources() during initialization
will result in copying all the Source Classes into the new class.

## Source Injection in Network
This Feature is used by all the Network classes. This way, it is possible to create a
new Source with the reference to the Network that created it, without needing to
explicitly provide the network in the __init__ call.
